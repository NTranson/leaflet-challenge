# Leaflet_Challenge

In this challenge, I used the leaflet module to visualize real-time earthquake data and tectonic plate boundaries on an interactive map.

## Features

- Interactive map with earthquake markers indicating the magnitude and depth.
- Different base layers for the map, including Satellite, Grayscale, and Outdoors views.
- Tectonic plate boundaries overlaid on the map for better understanding of seismic activity.
- Toggle control to display earthquakes and tectonic plates separately or together.
- A legend that explains the depth color-coding of the earthquake markers.

## Data Source

The earthquake data is sourced from the [United States Geological Survey (USGS)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) Earthquake Catalog.
